### **5. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies**

#### **Waterfall Methodology:**
- **Approach:** Linear and sequential.  
- **Phases:** Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.  
- **Best For:**  
  - Projects with stable, well-defined requirements (e.g., medical devices, government systems).  
  - Industries needing strict compliance and extensive documentation.  

#### **Agile Methodology:**
- **Approach:** Iterative and incremental.  
- **Phases:** Concept → Inception → Iteration/Development → Release → Maintenance.  
- **Best For:**  
  - Projects with evolving requirements (e.g., startups, mobile apps).  
  - Complex or innovative projects needing frequent adjustments.
